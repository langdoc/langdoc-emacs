According to recent [survey](http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2016/06/results-of-the-metadata-survey/) by Nick Thieberger, 48.1 % of field linguists are using pen and paper to manage their metadata. In many cases the metadata is derived from the recordings we do or from the notes we make while we record. The solution presented here serves in many ways the both situations, helping to structure the recorded content while it is being created, and making it easier to create our notes in digital format to start with.

In my own setup it works with Raspberry Pi, but I've also tested it well on Mac and that works well. I will write a blog post which goes through the rationale behind it, but the idea is quite simple.

- We want to make notes while recording
- This means we have to use some keyboard which makes very little sound
- OR we want to be in another room altogether (just get a long enough cable!)
- We want the notes to be time stamped
- Some things we write are repetitive, so there should be shortkeys for those in a format that is easy to customize 
- There has to be some way to bring time stamped notes into ELAN file as their own time aligned tier

How cool is that!

## Further ideas

Lots of this functionality could be tied into an Android program actually, where one could just use phone with suitable keyboard. However, this would be much more programming than simple Emacs mode needs.

One should really test the keyboards to find a good one which makes little noise.
